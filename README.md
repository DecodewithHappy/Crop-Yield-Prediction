## Overview


### About
Agricultural developments are the commonly ignored topic, yet so important for expansion of global economy
This project would suggest farmers for crop rotations absolutely based on data analysed on real time basis (that is the mineral content in the soil), unlike the traditional ways of cultivating only a few fixed type of crops on a fixed plot at a fixed time of the year, this would benefit the farmer, increment and add to his/her produce

Our main goal is to make availability of information related to crop cultivation a tad bit easier for the farmers by providing them with required information collected on real time-based predictions 

This model needs to be feeded with Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Potassium(N-P-K) content of the soil and some other important inputs such as time to sow or harvest the crop, optimal or general temperature suitable for its proper growth, most suitable crop to be grown on a given type of soil, soil ph range, rainfall or amount of water required, fertilizers requires and so on.
The climatic conditions based on the geographic conditions have also been taken into consideration in framing the whole process.

## My Process

### Algortihm Used
The implementation is done using Machine Learning trained algorithms which would collect the required dataset from an excel sheet (framed after extensive survey over specific crops) using the Pandas library in Python. 

To get the best-suited algorithm for the model, five different supervised machine learning algorithms are performed. The Algorithms are: -
1. Multiple Linear Regression.
2. Logistic Regression.
3. Support Vector Machine.
4. Decision Tree.
5. Random Forest classification.
